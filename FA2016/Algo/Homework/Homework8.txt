Homework #8


Given the following sequence of key-value pairs inserted in order into an initially empty symbol table answer the questions that follow.


	{ (H,0), (V,1), (O,2), (R,3), (F,4), (O,5), (R,6), (I,7), (K,8) }


What value would a call to size() return?








What would a search for O return?








What would a search for E return?












Starting with an empty binary search tree and inserting the following set of keys in the order given will produce a worst-case tree.   Find two other orderings of the keys that also produce a worst-case binary search tree when starting with an empty binary search tree.


 	{D, E, G, I, J, L, T }
























Starting with an initially empty binary search tree and inserting the following keys in the order given.  Answer the questions that follow after the key 35 has been deleted.


	  {  45, 35, 75, 20, 40, 15, 18, 37, 42, 36 }




What is key of the left child of the node with 45 as its key?










What is the size of the subtree rooted at the node with 36 as its key?










What is the key of the parent node of the node with 20 as its key?










What is the size of the subtree rooted at the node with 40 as its key?
