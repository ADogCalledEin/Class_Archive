In either "C" or Java, write a program
that implements a reverse polish calculator
involving the following functions :

//add
//sub
//mul
//div
//idiv
//mod
//sqrt
//sin
//cos

//pstack

//dup
//exch
//pop
//index
roll
//copy

dont forget about negatives on read in

Your program may either read the rpn file
directly or via input redirection.
