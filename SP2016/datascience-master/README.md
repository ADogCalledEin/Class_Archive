###Data Science 2016 class files

#####Contents
1. Homework 1
  - Just getting back into python and reaquainting ourselves with the ins and outs of the
    language
2. Homework 2
  - Starting in with data visualization using matplotlib. We were only supposed to use pure python, with matplotlib being the only external library, but I missed pandas and numpy and decided to start using those again. They're just too damn powerful to ignore. 
3. Homework 3
  - Basic bioinformatics problems. Again, I cheated a bit and used a library, but since I'm comfortable enough with using external libraries and can explain myself rather easily, the prof didn't have any issues with it.
4. Homework 4
  - Probability problems. Initially I assumed (incorrectly) that the two stacks of data that we were comparing for the main comparisons were independant. So I got a meh grade on it. So what. This is what happens when no test cases are provided.
5. Extra Problems
  - More problems from Rosalind on here. Bioinformatics 2 hmwk integrated into here as well. Yet more bullshit ensues.
